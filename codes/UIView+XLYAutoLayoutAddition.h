/*  these three methods can help to perform create, update and remake constraints for you. you just create constraints in the block,
 *  everything will be done for you.
 *
 *  you can also create constraint without using these three methods. For example:
 *
 *  NSLayoutConstraint *constraint = view.layoutTop.equalTo(otherView.layoutBottom).offset(@50).resultConstraint;
 *
 *  in this way, you can just create a constraint which can be used latter.
 *
 *  it's important that you can operate multi views together in the block, it's really convenient.

 *
 *  if no similar constraint found, the newly created constraint will active.
 *
 * apple says: priority property may only be modified as part of initial set up.  An exception will be thrown if it is set after a constraint has been added to a view. But it really can be modified after added to a view as long as the priority is not required. you can change priority from a to b where a and b are both less than 1000 and no exception is thrown. But  modify the priority here in my codes is not allowed.
