@interface NSLayoutConstraint (XLYAutoLayoutAddition)

/*  these three methods can help to perform create, update and remake constraints for you. you just create constraints in the block,
 *  everything will be done for you.
 *
 *  you can also create constraint without using these three methods. For example:
 *
 *  NSLayoutConstraint *constraint = view.xly_top.equalTo(otherView.xly_bottom).constaint(50).resultConstraint;
 *
 *  in this way, you can just create a constraint which can be used latter.
 *
 *  it's important that you can operate multi views together in the block, it's really convenient.
 */


/*
 * IMPORTANT:
 * 1. you must set 'translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints' to NO yourself. see the demo for usage.
 *
 * 2. direction should be 'NSLayoutFormatDirectionLeadingToTrailing'(default) or 'NSLayoutFormatDirectionLeftToRight' or 'NSLayoutFormatDirectionRightToLeft'.

/**
 *  make new constraints and then seek for last added constraint which is similar to the newly created constraint.
 *
 *  if a similar constraint is found then the old constraint will be replaced by the new one.
 *
 *  if no similar constraint found, the newly created constraint will active.
 *
 *  similar means two constaints' items and layout attributes are the same or reversed same, NOT concern about multiplier, priority or constant.
 *
 *
 * IMPORTANT:
 *
 * I treat change of multiplier, priority and constant all as update. I just remove the old one and active the new one, NOT modify the old one, so no exception will be thrown.
 * 
 * So, please make sure you know what 'xly_update' means when you use it. The recommended place to use it in '-[UIVIew updateConstraints]'.
